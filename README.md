# Airlines-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the company's database using Python and SQL to identify actionable insights that can help increase the occupancy rate of flights. By optimizing seat utilization, we aim to enhance the average profit earned per seat and improve overall financial performance.

The analysis will involve data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and querying flight and passenger data to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for improvement. Visualizations will also be created to support decision-making and present findings effectively.
